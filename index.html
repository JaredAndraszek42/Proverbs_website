    <h1>Welcome to Jared's notes on Proverbs</h1>
    <p>
        Proverbs is the 20th book of the Bible. It focuses on the wisdom bestowed to King Solomon
        (the greatest king of Israel) by God. This website takes the highlights of each chapter (31)
        and explains how I interpret them. Every day, there will be a new chapter added until 3/31.
        I also want it to be known that I use the NIV (New International Version) translation, so all
        quotes use that version.

        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            Chapter 1 starts with why wisdom is important and who this wisdom is from. It is stated that Solomon,
            the son of David, King of Israel recieved wisdom from the Lord in 1 Kings 3:12. These proverbs are the
            wisdom that Solomon recieved and is sharing to the world. <br>
            <br>
            For it is written:<br>
            <b>"<sup>1</sup>The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: <sup>2</sup>for attaining wisdom
                and
                discipline;
                for understanding words of insight; <sup>3</sup>for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing
                what is right
                and just and fair; " (Proverbs 1:1-3) </b> <br><br>

            We are then told that noone young or old should stop looking to wisdom and to continue our learning.
            As the young learn to grow and the old learn to guide.<br><br>

            For it is written:<br>
            <b>"<sup>4</sup>for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young-
                <sup>5</sup>let
                the
                wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance- <sup>6</sup>for
                understanding
                proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise" (Proverbs 1:4-6)</b> <br><br>

            We then are told our first piece of wisdom and that is <b>"<sup>7</sup>The fear of the Lord is the
                beginning
                of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline."</b> So we must start with fearing the lord
            and the judgement we face for our sins before we can truely start learning and becoming wise in the eyes
            of God.<br><br>

            The next section of Chapter 1 speaks about embracing wisdom and a warning against enticement. <br>
            We start with a call for us to listen to what is stated in verses 8 and 9. <br><br>

            For it is written:<br>
            <b>"<sup>8</sup>Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
                <sup>9</sup>They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck."
                (Proverbs 1:8-9)</b> <br><br>

            We then transition to not giving into the sinners of the world with their murder, theft, and ignorance.
            <br><br>

            For it is written:<br>
            <b>"<sup>10</sup>My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them. <sup>11</sup>If they say,
                'Come along with us: let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;
                <sup>12</sup>let's swallow them alive like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
                <sup>13</sup>we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;
                <sup>14</sup>throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse'-" (Proverbs 1:10-14)</b>

            <br><br>We then are told not to go with them, as they rush to sin and shed blood to where they end up
            shedding themselves as they are then the targets of sinners. So do not take the ill-gotten gains, as
            anyone
            who does will die. We are also told in verse 17 that even the animals are smart enough to not fall for a
            trap when the hunter is setting it up.

            <br><br>For it is written:<br>
            <b>"<sup>15</sup>my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;
                <sup>16</sup>for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.
                <sup>17</sup>How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds
                <sup>18</sup>These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!
                <sup>19</sup>Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those
                who
                get it."
                (Proverbs 1:15-19)</b> <br><br>


            However, if we fail to embrace wisdom, we are given a warning against rejecting Wisdom. We start with
            Wisdom, personified as a woman/mother figure calling out to everyone in the
            streets, public squares, and other public areas offering knowledge to those who want it.


            <br><br>For it is written:<br>
            <b>"<sup>20</sup>Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;
                <sup>21</sup>at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes
                her
                speech:
                <sup>22</sup>'How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in
                mockery and fools hate knowledge?"
                (Proverbs 1:20-22)</b> <br><br>

            However, if we refuse Wisdom's knowledge, Wisdom will turn her back on those that refused it when
            difficult times come. <br><br>

            For it is written: <br>
            <b>"<sup>23</sup>If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my
                thoughts known to you.
                <sup>24</sup>But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heet when I stretched out my
                hand,
                <sup>25</sup>since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,
                <sup>26</sup>I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you-
                <sup>27</sup>when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a
                whirlwind,
                when distress and trouble overwhelm you."
                (Proverbs 1:23-27)</b> <br><br>

            At this point those that refused Wisdom will realize the mistake they made and will call out for help
            from
            Wisdom, but she will not be there. Because they chose not to fear the Lord and chose not to have
            knowledge,
            they chose not to have the safety and ease Wisdom offered.<br><br>

            For it is written: <br>
            <b>"<sup>28</sup>Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not
                find
                me.
                <sup>29</sup>Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,
                <sup>30</sup>since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
                <sup>31</sup>they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
                <sup>32</sup>For the waywardmess of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will
                destroy
                them;
                <sup>33</sup>but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of
                harm."</b>
